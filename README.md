# Quantum-Safe Signature Demo

This applications stores a higly-classified answer to one of the
Questions of the Open-House Quiz!

In order to access the secret, IBMers can pickup their credentials at
the booth. To make sure that unauthorized entities with or without a
quantum computer cannot forge credentials and steal the secret we use
one of IBM's latest **Quantum-Safe Digital Signature schemes** to
authenticate the credentials.

Your credential consists of a digitally signed message (your name)
using one of the quantum-safe signature schemes SQIsign, Mayo, UOV or
FAEST. These signature schemes are candidates for standardisation by
NIST.

Each QR code sticker was generated by applying the chosen signing
algorithm to your name, using the algorithm and our secret key.

The QR code encodes a URL with a signed message inside. The first
digit encodes your choice of signature algorithm, while the rest of
the URL encodes the signature and the message.

Signatures for the SQIsign, Mayo and UOV signature algorithms are
small, and can fit in one QR code, but FAEST signatures are larger and
require two QR codes.

The vault application verifies your signature using the public key for
the signature algorithm you selected. Only if the signature is valid,
we will open the vault and reveal the answer to the quiz question.
